## System Architecture

### Frontend Components

- **BookLearningApp.js**: Main application component handling the core UI and user interactions
- **LearningAid.js**: Reusable components for displaying various types of learning content
- **AuthContext.js**: Authentication context provider for Firebase authentication

### Services

- **chatService.js**: Handles chat-related operations with Firebase
- **openai.js**: Manages communication with OpenAI API for generating responses

### Key Features Implementation

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Implemented using Firebase Authentication
   - Managed through AuthContext for global state management

2. **Chat System**
   - Real-time chat persistence using Firebase Firestore
   - Structured message format with support for various content types
   - Automatic chat history saving and retrieval

3. **AI Integration**
   - OpenAI GPT-4 integration for intelligent responses
   - Structured response format including:
     - Main answer
     - Learning aids
     - Follow-up questions

4. **Learning Progress**
   - Four-stage learning process:
     1. Aim (Goal Setting)
     2. Listen (Content Overview)
     3. Talk (Interactive Discussion)
     4. Reflect (Understanding Review)

5. **UI/UX Features**
   - Responsive sidebar for book selection and navigation
   - Progress tracking bar
   - Interactive message components
   - Dynamic learning aids
   - Real-time chat interface

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Add the following security rules to Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /chats/{chatId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                           request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## OpenAI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for generating responses. The integration:

- Maintains a consistent response format
- Includes error handling and response parsing
- Supports various types of learning aids and prompts
